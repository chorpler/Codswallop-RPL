- Type compatibility/inheritance scheme
- STOTO/RCLFROM for updating tag types
- Move >STR from python to sysrpl (and consolidate with DISP?)
- Figure out how to do user types

done - Tag parser
done - Tags in LOCAL arglists for constants
done - Store symbols as already-split lists of strings
done - Allow storing to firstobj (null store, anonymous local)
done - Tag/tuple type: ('symbol': value) or (car, cdr)

Named store (car, cdr ->) (car, cdr ->) (nil, nil)
              |             |
              v             v
        ('sym':value) ('sym':value)

Named store will effectively work with a universal symbol find function,
which will (if successful) return a tuple which can be modified
